## Welcome to my notebook

It's always cool to have a personal space to note down something, and may or may not share it with the world.\
Though, in most cases it can be just some mumbo-jumbos coming out of my mouth ðŸ˜¹

### Markdown

I am choosing Markdown to format my notes, because it's a light-weighted and powerful tool to use... \
*(nope, because I don't really know anything about html)*

For more details see: [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

### Jekyll

This Github Page is set up with a Jekyll theme called [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). There are still a ton of things I don't quite understand about this Jekyll. \
So yeah baby steps, don't rush it!
